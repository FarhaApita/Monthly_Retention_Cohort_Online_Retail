# Analysis Insight
* Consider a cohort analysis of customers who made their first purchase in December 2010. If you find that this cohort has a retention rate of 33% in January 2011, 39% in February 2011, 36% in March 2011and April 2011 40%, it indicates a fluctuating trend and tends to increase in retention over subsequent months.
* If we look diagonally, customer that purchased in November 2011 have increased, which show us the customer that online retail have previously acquired come back and buy again.
